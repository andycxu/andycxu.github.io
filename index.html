										Subreddit Classification</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/reddit.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										As a member in the Reddit maintain team, it's my job to ensure all post belong to the corresponding subreddits. Recently, reddit users complained more and more about misplaced posts which increased the reading difficultness. 
										In order to maintain users' satisfication and web traffic, our team is required to create a solution to accurately classify posts into correct subreddits. 
										In this project, subreddits of piano and drum are selected as initial model setup. Mutiple classification and NLP technqiues are used to train a model that the model is able to classify a post either belongs to piano or drum. 
										The goal is to increase the accuracy rate as higher as possible.

										Severity of Air Crashes</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/crash.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										As an airplane fan, it is both my personal and public attention about the air travel safety. 
										Although air travel is one of the safest transportation nowadays, the risk still exist, especially the high injury and mortality rate when single accident occurred. 
										In order to help publics to understand more about the plane crashes, this study utilizes the features of aircraft type and age, operator, flight phase, crash site and time in the historical airplane crash records and explores the severeness of crash, whether there is survivor or not.
